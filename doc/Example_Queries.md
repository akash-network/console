## Cross database queries from chain-db (indexer) and user db

User db stores the addresses of the managed wallet users and if we want to query the indexer db to compute amount spent, we need to do a cross database query.

This query will fetch the sum of all spent for all the users per day.

```
-- First, enable postgres_fdw extension in both databases
CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw;

-- In the user db database, create the foreign server connection to the chain database
CREATE SERVER chain_db
  FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw
  OPTIONS (host 'localhost', port '5432', dbname 'console-akash');

-- Create user mapping
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR CURRENT_USER
  SERVER chain_db
  OPTIONS (user 'postgres', password 'your_password');

IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA public 
  LIMIT TO (lease, block, day)
  FROM SERVER chain_db 
  INTO public;
  
-- Create foreign tables for the tables we need
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE chain_lease (
    id uuid,
    owner character varying(255),
    denom character varying(255),
    price double precision,
    "createdHeight" integer,
    "closedHeight" integer,
    "predictedClosedHeight" numeric(30,0)
) SERVER chain_db
OPTIONS (schema_name 'public', table_name 'lease');

CREATE FOREIGN TABLE chain_block (
    height integer,
    datetime timestamp with time zone,
    "dayId" uuid
) SERVER chain_db
OPTIONS (schema_name 'public', table_name 'block');

CREATE FOREIGN TABLE chain_day (
    id uuid,
    date timestamp with time zone,
    "aktPrice" double precision,
	"firstBlockHeight" integer,
	"lastBlockHeight" integer,
	"lastBlockHeightYet" integer
) SERVER chain_db
OPTIONS (schema_name 'public', table_name 'day');

-- Query the amount spent per day for all the trial or non-trial users, just change w.trial = true or false
WITH daily_leases AS (
    SELECT 
        d.date, 
        l.id,
        ((LEAST(d."lastBlockHeightYet", COALESCE(l."closedHeight", l."predictedClosedHeight")) - GREATEST(d."firstBlockHeight", l."createdHeight")) * l.price) AS "uusdc_spent"
    FROM chain_day d
    INNER JOIN chain_lease l ON l."createdHeight" < d."lastBlockHeightYet" AND COALESCE(l."closedHeight", l."predictedClosedHeight") > d."firstBlockHeight"
