## Cross database queries from chain-db (indexer) and user db

User db stores the addresses of the managed wallet users and if we want to query the indexer db to compute amount spent, we need to do a cross database query.

This query will fetch the sum of all spent for all the users per day.

-- Create user mapping
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR CURRENT_USER
