            Read the issue context from .pm/${{ github.event.issue.number }}/context.md.
            Explore the codebase to understand the relevant architecture, patterns, and conventions.
            Create a design proposal and write it to .pm/${{ github.event.issue.number }}/plan.md.

            This document will be used by the team to discuss and agree on the approach
            before implementation begins. Focus on design, not code-level details.

            The document should include:
            - Problem statement: what needs to change and why
            - Proposed approach: high-level design and architecture decisions
            - Alternatives considered: other approaches and why they were rejected
            - Affected areas: which parts of the system are impacted (apps, packages, APIs, DB, etc.)
            - Open questions: decisions that need team input
            - Suggested task breakdown: how this work could be split into smaller deliverables
