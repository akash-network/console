## Quick Start

To get started with Akash Console, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:akash-network/console.git ./akash-console
cd akash-console
npm run dc:up:dev -- deploy-web 
```

This will start the deploy-web service in development mode with all the necessary dependencies (API, indexer, PostgreSQL). It will also import a backup of the sandbox database by default to speed up the process.

## Project Structure and Services

This project is structured as a monorepo, allowing us to manage multiple related applications and shared packages in a single repository.

![Dataflow between services](infra.drawio.png)

## Applications

All services are Node.js applications written in TypeScript and deployed using Docker. Both databases are PostgreSQL.

- [Console](./apps/deploy-web/): The main website for deploying on Akash, built using the Next.js framework. Data is fetched from a combination of our API and Akash nodes (REST).
  - [console.akash.network](https://console.akash.network)
- [Stats](./apps/stats/): The stats website built using Next.js, displaying the usage data of the Akash Network from the Indexer database.
  - [stats.akash.network](https://stats.akash.network)
- [Api](./apps/api/): Provides data to the deploy website, fetching from our Indexer database.
  - [console-api.akash.network](https://console-api.akash.network/v1/swagger)
- [Indexer](./apps/indexer/): Fetches the latest blocks from RPC nodes and saves blocks & stats to our Indexer Database. For details on how the indexer works, see the [Indexer README](./indexer/README.md).
- [Provider Proxy](./apps/provider-proxy/): Used in the deploy website to proxy requests to providers. This is necessary since it's not possible to use the cert authentication system from the browser.

## Shared Packages

We utilize a `/packages` folder to define reusable packages that can be shared between applications. This approach promotes code reuse, maintainability, and consistency across our services. Some examples of shared packages include:

- Common utilities
- Shared types and interfaces
- Reusable UI components
- Shared configuration files

By leveraging this monorepo structure with shared packages, we can efficiently manage dependencies, streamline development workflows, and ensure consistency across our various applications.

For more information on how to use or contribute to shared packages, please refer to the code within each package in the `/packages` directory.

## Running the Application

This document provides instructions on how to set up and run the application, including steps for manual database restoration and using Docker Compose for ease of setup.

### Using Docker and Docker Compose
This project's service are deployed using Docker and Docker Compose. The following sections provide instructions for setting up and running the application using Docker Compose.
All the Dockerfiles are using multi-stage builds to optimize the image build processes. Same files are used to build both development and production images. 

There are 3 docker-compose files:
- **docker-compose.build.yml:** Base file solely building production images for the services. It can be used to verify the same build process as in CICD.
- **docker-compose.prod.yml:** This file is used to run the services in production mode. It also includes the database service which would fetch a remote backup and import it on init.
- **docker-compose.yml:** The default file to run all the services in development mode with features like hot-reload.

Some commands are added to package.json for convenience.

```shell
npm run dc:build # Build the production images
npm run dc:up:prod # Run the services in production mode
npm run dc:up:dev # Run the services in development mode
npm run dc:down # Stop the services referencing any possible service
```

Note: you may pass any `docker compose` related arguments to the above commands. E.g. to only start `deploy-web` service in development mode:
```shell
npm run dc:up:dev -- deploy-web
```
This would also properly spin up all the dependencies like the `api`.
### Using Turbo Repo
Another way to run apps in dev mode is using turbo repo setup. Some available commands are:
```shell
npm run console:dev # run console ui in dev mode with dependencies
npm run stats:dev # run stats ui in dev mode with dependencies
npm run api:dev # run api in dev mode with dependencies
npm run indexer:dev # run indexer in dev mode with dependencies
```

Note the above commands still depend on docker to run postgres database. If you need to run them without db you can use the following commands:
```shell
npm run console:dev:no-db # run console ui in dev mode with dependencies but without postgres in docker
npm run stats:dev:no-db # run stats ui in dev mode with dependencies but without postgres in docker
```

## Manual Database Restoration

Due to the extensive time required to index Akash from block #1, it's recommended to initialize your database using an existing backup for efficiency. This approach is particularly beneficial for development purposes.

### Available Backups

- **Mainnet Database (~30 GB):** [console-akash-mainnet.sql.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/console-postgresql-backups/console-akash-mainnet.sql.gz)
  - Suitable for scenarios requiring complete data.
- **Sandbox Database (< 300 MB):** [console-akash-sandbox.sql.gz](https://storage.googleapis.com/console-postgresql-backups/console-akash-sandbox.sql.gz)
  - Ideal for most development needs, although it may lack recent chain updates.

### Restoration Steps

1. Create a PostgreSQL database.
2. Restore the database using `psql`. Ensure PostgreSQL tools are installed on your system.

For a .sql.gz file:
```sh
gunzip -c /path/to/console-akash-sandbox.sql.gz | psql --host "localhost" --port "5432" --username "postgres" --dbname "console-akash"
```
After restoring the database, you can proceed with the specific project's README instructions for further setup and running the application.

## Database Structure

Our project uses a dual ORM approach for database management:

1. **Sequelize-TypeScript**: 
   - Used for defining the primary database schema.
   - Schema definitions are located in [/shared/dbSchemas/](./shared/dbSchemas/).
   - Models are organized into the following folders:
     - **base**: Tables which are Cosmos generic and used for every chain
     - **akash**: Tables which are Akash-specific
     - **user**: Tables which are user-specific, containing tables for user settings and templates

2. **Drizzle ORM**:
   - Utilized in the API for database operations.
   - Configuration can be found in `drizzle.config.ts` in the API directory.

The use of both ORMs allows us to leverage the strengths of each:
- Sequelize-TypeScript provides robust schema definition and migration capabilities.
- Drizzle ORM offers type-safe queries and improved performance for API operations.

For more details on the Drizzle ORM setup and usage, refer to the `drizzle.config.ts` file in the API directory.

Note: We're planning on migrating all the models to drizzle eventually, so when you want to add new tables please add them using drizzle.

## Environment Variables

Our project uses a structured approach to manage environment variables across different applications and environments:

1. Each app under the `apps/` directory has its own `/env` folder.
2. Inside each `/env` folder, you'll find:
   - `.env.sample`: A template file showing the required environment variables.
   - `.env.local`: For local development (git-ignored).
   - `.env.staging`: For staging environment.
   - `.env.production`: For production environment.

We use **dotenvx** for managing and loading environment variables, which allows for features like variable interpolation.

Environment variables follow the standard Next.js behavior, with files like `.env.local` or `.env.production` automatically loaded based on the current environment.

To set up your local environment:
1. Copy `.env.sample` to `.env.local` in the respective app's `/env` folder.
2. Fill in the required values in `.env.local`.

Note: Never commit sensitive information in `.env.sample` or any non-local .env files to version control.
