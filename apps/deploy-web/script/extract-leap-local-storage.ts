/**
 * Script to extract Leap extension's local storage from Chrome for E2E tests
 *
 * WHY THIS SCRIPT IS NEEDED:
 *
 * When running E2E tests with Playwright that interact with browser extensions like Leap Wallet,
 * we need to pre-populate the extension's local storage with authentication state and wallet data.
 * This allows tests to bypass manual wallet setup and login flows.
 *
 * However, browser extension storage (chrome.storage.local) is isolated and can only be accessed
 * from within the extension's own context - not from external scripts or Playwright automation.
 *
 * This script provides step-by-step instructions for manually extracting the storage data
 * from a properly configured Leap Wallet extension, which can then be loaded into the test
 * environment to simulate an authenticated wallet state.
 *
 * This script provides instructions to manually extract the storage data
 * because chrome.storage API is only accessible from extension contexts.

To extract Leap extension's local storage:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to: chrome://extensions/

2. Enable 'Developer mode' (toggle in top-right corner)

3. Find 'Leap Cosmos Wallet' and click one of:
   - 'Inspect views: background page' (for Manifest V2)
   - 'service worker' link (for Manifest V3)

4. In the DevTools console that opens, paste and run:

   chrome.storage.local.get(null, (data) => {
     console.log(JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
     console.log('\\nâœ“ Storage data printed above - select and copy it manually');
   });

5. Select the JSON output in the console, right-click and copy it
   
6. Paste the clipboard content into:
   ${outputPath}

${"=".repeat(70)}
`);

  checkCurrentStorage(outputPath);
